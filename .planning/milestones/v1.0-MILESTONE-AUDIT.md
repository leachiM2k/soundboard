# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 — iPhone Soundboard PWA
**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** passed
**Phases:** 3/3 complete

---

## Executive Summary

All 17 v1 requirements are satisfied. All three phases passed automated and human verification. Cross-phase integration is fully wired with no broken connections. All 5 E2E user flows are complete. Two minor tech debt items were identified — neither blocks any requirement.

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Name | VERIFICATION Status | Score | Human Tests |
|-------|------|---------------------|-------|-------------|

## Integration Check

**Cross-phase wiring:** 17/17 requirements fully wired
**Orphaned exports:** 1 (shouldShowInstallBanner — unnecessary export, not consumed externally, no behavioral issue)
**Missing connections:** 0
**Broken flows:** 0

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Key Path |
|------|--------|----------|
| Record new sound | ✓ Complete | tap → getMicrophoneStream → startRecording → saveSlot → has-sound state |
| Playback | ✓ Complete | tap → playBlob → AudioBufferSourceNode → onEnded → has-sound |
| Long-press management | ✓ Complete | touchstart → 500ms → showActionSheet → delete/rename/re-record |
| PWA install | ✓ Complete | manifest → apple-touch-icon → Add to Home Screen → standalone |
| Offline operation | ✓ Complete | sw.js precache → airplane mode → cache serve → IndexedDB playback |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 01: Audio and Storage Pipeline
- **`warningActive` flag with no visual consumer** — `main.ts` sets `warningActive: true` on `TileData` at the 25-second recording mark, but `tile.ts` never reads this field. No CSS class or visual change results at 25s beyond the timer countdown. REC-03 is satisfied (pulse animation active throughout). If a future UX polish phase adds a visual "warning" state to the tile at 25s, this flag is already in place.

### Phase 03: PWA Shell and Offline
- **`shouldShowInstallBanner` unnecessary export** — The function is exported from `install-banner.ts` but only called internally by `showInstallBanner()`. The export is harmless but unused. Could be made private in a cleanup pass.

**Total tech debt: 2 items across 2 phases. Neither blocks any v1 requirement.**

---

## Anti-Patterns

None found across any phase. No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK/PLACEHOLDER strings in production code. No stub implementations. No empty handlers. All exported functions have substantive implementations.

## Out-of-Scope (v2 Backlog)

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| UX-01 | Real-time waveform visualization during recording (AnalyserNode + Canvas) |
| UX-02 | Confirmation dialog when deleting a recording |
| UX-03 | Pre-loaded AudioBuffer cache on app start |
| RES-01 | Graceful handling of getUserMedia re-permission bug (WebKit #215884) in standalone mode |
| RES-02 | Storage usage indicator |
